# Image Classification (CV)

**Summary**  
CNN or transfer learning for coral/fish images.

## Goals
- [ ] Define the research/business question
- [ ] Acquire and document data source(s)
- [ ] Clean & preprocess data
- [ ] EDA with clear visuals and commentary
- [ ] Baseline model (if applicable)
- [ ] Improve with feature engineering / model tuning
- [ ] Evaluate with appropriate metrics
- [ ] Conclusions & next steps

## Data
- **Source(s):** _link here_
- **Data dictionary:** _add brief field descriptions_
- **License/Usage:** _note any restrictions_

## How to Reproduce
