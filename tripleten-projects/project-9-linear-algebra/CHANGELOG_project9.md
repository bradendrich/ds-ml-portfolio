# CHANGELOG — Linear Algebra Project

## [1.0.0] — Initial GitHub Release
- Cleaned notebook to remove reviewer comments.
- Added professional README.md describing all tasks.
- Created CHANGELOG.md documenting version notes.
- Added requirements.txt for reproducibility.
- Ensured descriptions of cosine similarity, linear regression math, and data masking are clearly explained.

## Potential Enhancements (v1.1+)
- Add visualization of cosine similarity neighborhoods.
- Add geometric interpretation plots (2D projections).
- Implement PCA before similarity search.
- Provide proofs for invertibility and determinant logic for obfuscation matrices.
- Add cross-validation for regression modeling.
